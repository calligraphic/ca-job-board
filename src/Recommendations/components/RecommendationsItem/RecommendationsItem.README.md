Idea to let former employers write recommendation letters for employees,maybe ability to pull them in from linkedin or facebook or something by the job seeker.

THIS OVERLAPS WITH REFERENCES

The difference is that references would be uploaded by the job seeker, with recommendations require the person making the reference to create an account and write the reference on the system.

How to merge?
