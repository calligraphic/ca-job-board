##### Panel View

Lots of blog posts advising to make prices publicly viewable. 

The Price List view should pick up the system price for a package, so there's no danger of getting out of sync. Do not require registration to see them.

Simple horizontal layout:

![priceList4](../../../../public/images/priceList4.png)



![priceList5](../../../../public/images/priceList5.png)



![priceList6](../../../../public/images/priceList6.png)
