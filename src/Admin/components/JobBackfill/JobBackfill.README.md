“Who would waste his time posting a listing on an empty job site? Smartjobboard offers free integrations with such job aggregators as Indeed, ZipRecruiters and Jobs2Careers. So, your job board will always be full of new jobs. And you’ll get a revenue share every time someone clicks those jobs.”

And Job8 integration:

“For even more relevant jobs, you can integrate your job board with a unique JobG8 network and job applications marketplace. Just imagine thousands of job boards exchange jobs and applicants. You can become a part of this network too and make extra cash.“

“Jobg8 (pronounced job-gate) is a unique network and job application marketplace. Jobg8 offers cutting edge opportunities for niche, regional and generalist boards. Our integration with Jobg8 allows our customers access to all of Jobg8’s products and benefit from their advanced services.
