##### Credits vs. Subscriptions

Products that can be added to the **Shopping Cart** include **Credits** and **Subscriptions**. Either can involve either a one-time payment or a recurring (monthly) payment.

##### Invoice Template

Set up a template for invoices in the back end:

![invoice1](../../../../public/images/invoice1.png)

When customers click the “Place order” button after choosing "Pay by Invoice" as their payment option, they should see payment instructions that were entered in the admin panel:

![invoice2](../../../../public/images/invoice2.png)

##### Invoice Admin Create

You can automatically create an invoice in the back-end and if needed can configure to send or manually send this invoice to your customer for submitting a payment. Should be able to send a CC to an admin email address set in the system.

##### Monthly Statements

Need to be able to create monthly statements with a CC to an admin email address set in the system.

##### Payment Methods

- Paypal, with single payments and subscriptions options
- Stripe
- Pay by Invoice (pay either in cash, through a bank transfer, or by check)
