**See Application Item View for more information.**

When a job seeker successfully applies to a job posting, they should be shown a similar jobs list with "Quick apply" link next to each job, when using the internal app system.  If not, it should show an "Apply" link and send the user to  the company's own application web page.

The email address set in the Employer's Job Posting is used to forward applications created in the system via:

- The default email address for the company, 
- the user's email address that is creating a job posting, or
- a custom email address.  

Different pieces of an application:

- Application form
- Custom Fields
- Resume upload
- References
- Video Message
