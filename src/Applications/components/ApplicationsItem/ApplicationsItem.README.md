WP Job Board has link to Applications in their Employer Panel. This is a reserve side of showing all job listings, with a link icon to the number of resumes for each job. Lists all resumes by job applied to. Should probably let employer block resumes from a given user. Any option for resumes sent without a particular job, just cold-call? Maybe each employer has a special listing called “cold-call”?

Employers should have a screen to set up Resume Alerts, just as Job Seekers can set up Job Alerts. Employers should be able to receive automated resume alerts via notification, social media, SMS, or email when new candidates are registered as per criteria specified: keywords, categories, locations, etc. Employer can set frequency of updates to either daily or weekly.

Display **custom fields**. Item view needs a **section organization**, so the custom fields know where to display.

Smartjobboard has "Customize Job Fields" option:

Maybe there should be an option in Job Listing Item View to set this on a per-job basis, but seems like it would usually be global:

- application to be processed by job board and notification sent via email
- applicant to be redirected to employer URL / ATS interface

##### Application Alert

Allow system to be configured with a delay on alerts going to employers for new applications, or verify with the applicant that they're ready to send. This is so job seeker completes as much of their application as possible.
