##### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The underlying system needs to support RBAC for the Profiles defined in this module:

- **Super Administrator:** Super admin has complete visibility and rights across jobs, candidates, calendars and templates.
- **Job Administrator:** Same as Super admin, but only for jobs assigned to them.
- **Recruiter:** Assigned on a per-job basis. They receive an email with the details automatically when assigned to a job. Recruiters only have access to view and comment on the candidates they supply.  Opening can have one or more recruiters.
- **Hiring Manager:** Each job can have one or more hiring managers. Hiring managers can view all the information about candidates but can't change the job description or advertise jobs. Has access to the entire pipeline for jobs they're assigned to, including confidential comments and emails. 
- **Interviewers:** Interviewers can see the candidates profiles they are going to interview but can't reject candidates or move them across the pipelines. Workable.com calls them "Hiring Team Members". They can view candidate profiles and screen, progress or disqualify candidates, but cannot see or create confidential comments or messages.
