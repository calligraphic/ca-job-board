##### Notes with no good place to put them:

- Need a Google Invisible **reCaptcha** library. Use it on all forms, especially the Apply redirect page.
- **Google Indexing** - Integration With Google Job Search (makes sure Google indexes job listings)
- **Terms of Service / Privacy Policy Pages** - mandatory to use Twitter, Facebook APIs
- **FCRA Compliance Notice** - if background checks provided, need a CMS page with Fair Credit Reporting Act information
- **Forms** - Be able to customize all job board forms from the admin screen:
- **Geocoding** / **Geotagging**
- **SEF URLs**, for example searching for jobs in Texas gives http://example.com/jobs/texas
- Push newly posted jobs into the JomSocia l /EasySocial feed, but only for those in the same geographical area.
- "**Why Become**" a job seeker or employer pages, with links to tools and resoures.
- **Job Fair** functionality is not included in this iteration.
- **Social Media Job Communities** - A Reddit-like discussion board feature, where there are “Job Communities”, and you can follow different ones. Maybe best implemented as Facebook Pages (rather than a discussion board / Kunena or internal social network features / JomSocial):
- **Affiliate Program** - Beyond.com has an affiliate program for display ads, etc. Pay for users that are driven back to Beyond.com, they provide XML feed with their job listings, compensation for each new memberships

**Facebook Recruitment App** / **Apply With Facebook** 

See Facebook API doc for technical notes. Idea is to provide a Jobs Tab on the Company's Facebook Page.

Smartjobboard adds search by title and location, and automatically updates their Facebook app whenever Employers add or remove jobs. The application I think takes over the Facebook page. Smartjobboard's FB app allows the company's logo and header image to appear.
