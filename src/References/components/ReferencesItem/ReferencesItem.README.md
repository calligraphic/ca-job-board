References are recommendation letters for job seekers, written by third parties. Job seekers can add reference contacts, and the system will message that reference directly asking for a recommendation letter. References need to return to the site, login (probably with a social media account), and leave the reference letter. If a profile picture is not available from the reference's social media account used to register, they should be asked to provide one ("make the job seeker's profile look better to employers, giving them a better chance to land the job").

Tracking information added to the link given to a reference writer can be used to take them automatically to the page where they write their reference letter, with some fields pre-filled in (the job seeker's username and name, for example).

References can be contacted either via email or via social media. Requests for reference letters should be motivating, like "Hi Jennifer, Amanda needs your help! She has added her resume to our system and needs your recommendation to make her stand out!".
