​    @todo Need to include resume search view in list views

​    @todo Featured Resumes module

Display **custom fields**. Item view needs a **section organization**, so the custom fields know where to display.

Fields:

- About Me (with photo, short blurb and "download resume")
- Available For (part time/full time)
- Skills
- Education
- Experience
- Portfolio
- Profile– picture, contact info, etc.
- Contact Me button or method. WP Jobus includes linkes to job seer's social media accounts.
