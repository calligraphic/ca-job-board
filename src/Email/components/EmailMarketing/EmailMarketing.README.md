##### Email Marketing



##### Job Seeker / Team Member (including intra-team) Email

Webmail client built-in for contact with candidates

> "we can integrate you gmail or office 365 email and calendar. When you send an email in the platform and they respond you will get a notification that a candidate has replied and you click a button to go into the platform to respond from the notification email. Or if you do the integration the emails would show up directly in your gmail or 365 account."

>  "you would just add different users with their email address, the reply email would be @candidate-(ID of candidate)- breezy.com"

**Groupware**

Including this in email, because it presumably will be an integration with Jomsocial groups. Could include Slack integration. Nice to allow using social media-style `@-mentions`.

**Video Teleconferencing**

Again, including here for lack of a better place. Allow video teleconferencing from within the App, maybe with a few options - like the Whatsapp JS module.
