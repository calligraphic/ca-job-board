Item view - should have category metadata and linked Category Page

Tags and Categories are stored in same table, just differ in owner (categories are owned by the system, tags by users). Employers see the system job categories and their own tags whenever they need to categorize a job posting, same with other areas that use job categories like the Connector and Recruiter screens.

##### Job Category views (career profiles)

Job Category Description pages - Need landing pages for the different job categories,  one for each career field. Maybe resources for people in those professions â€“ selling opportunity, SEO advantages. The muse has a really nice design:

- Map with salary ranges in different cities;
- Day-to-day responsibility description;
- Skills needed;
- What it's Like with a video presentation;
- Some blog articles about the profession;
- Hire a career coach;
- Check out these other careers;
- E-mail sign up for more career advice and content.

##### Job Pages by Geographic Area

Should automatically build a job page for cities when a job is posted in that city, including:

- Jobs in that city
- Employers who have historically posted jobs in that city
- c. Networking opportunities, maybe
  Maybe list Insiders in that area

- Press releases about acquisitions/etc in that area.

Needs admin page to configure what RSS feeds to pull to populate "Press releases", news, and blog articles about a city.

##### Tags

Employer-defined tags to add to jobs, and show in a tag-cloud. Allows extension to the Job Category mechanism, since categories can only be defined by admin.

##### Organizing Job Categories

To avoid long list of job categories, break up into **area** and **title**:

*What business area does this job listing belong to
*

- Construction
- Finance
- Front Office
- Leasing
- Maintenance
- Management
- Marketing
- Support (IT, Tax Compliance, etc.)
- Other

*Which of our internal job titles best describes this position (for applicants using the search feature)
*

- Leasing Associate
- Leasing Consultant
- Leasing Coordinator

- Senior Leasing Consultant

*Can you give a "headline" style description for the job you are listing to help interest applicants in your job (for example, "Fun Community Needs Leasing Professional")
*
