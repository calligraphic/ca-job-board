##### Statistics / Analytics

From the specs:

> We want to track the effectiveness of all lead sources, such as Indeed.  So upon application submittal, the following page must send a signal to Google Analytics that application was successful, so we can track success based upon referral source.

SmartJobBoard has “Performance Reports” - 

> “You can see which employers and jobs attract more traffic, get more applications, and market your job board site accordingly. Share this data with your employers to show them how they are performing on your site.”

From Google:

> “Conversion Tracking in Google Analytics - Automatic Google Analytics integration allows you to easily track different conversions in your GA account”

**Google Analytics metrics to tracks:**

**Events**

- Number of website visitors so you can check how many people are coming to your website.
- Number of job views so you know that your job board website is meeting visitor needs.
- Number of applications so you can check people are applying to jobs.
- Number of job seeker sign ups so you know people want to register.
- Number of employers sign ups so you know employers want to post jobs.
- Number of jobs posted so you can check you can meet your revenue goals.

**Conversions (Goals representing completed activities)**

- When a person signs up to your newsletter.
- Posts a job to your job board website.
- Applies to a job on your job board website.
- Stays on your website for a certain period of time.
- Visits from a particular channel.

**Google Analytics Key Measures**

- **Users** - how many users your job board website gets on a daily basis.
- **Sessions** - the number of unique “sessions” people spend browsing your content - for example, if you have 100 users, and 120 sessions, 20 users may have visited twice.
- **Page views** - the total number of pages visitors accessed on your website.
- **Pages / session** - the average number of pages one visitor looked at in one session.
- **Bounce rate** - the percentage of people who just visited one page of your website and then left.
- **Top channels** - the percentage of sessions that came via referral, social media, organic search, direct, and through other means - channels are simply a grouping of visits into similar types (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc would be grouped under “social media.”)
- **Goals** - the specific goals you set to track things like job postings, job board visits, recruiter signups, and more.
- **Conversions** - the number and percentage of sessions that resulted in a desired action being taken such as posting a job or applying to one.

  Organization of the **Google Analytics interface**

- The **Audience section** tells you everything you need to know about the people who visit your job board website including how many there are, where they come from, demographics, location, the devices they use, and other information.
- The **Acquisition section** tells you how people found and arrived at your job board website in the first place. It includes the channels they used, the source of the visit, Google AdWords PPC visits, organic search details, and social media.
- The **Behavior section** tells you how people interact with your website once they have arrived. It includes the pages they viewed, the content they consumed, unique page views, how they moved through your website, and more.
- The **Conversion section** is slightly different to the other sections, in that Google Analytics reports on what you tell it to. It bases these reports around “goals” that you set in the tool.

Categorizing paths that candidates take to get into the job board's ATS pipeline (candidate sourcing):

- **Organic traffic** - From an organic search result to the product page;
- **Organic from internal link** - From an organic search result to content on the site, and then they travel to the product page from an internal link;
- **Referral / backlink traffic** - Same as the first two scenarios, except coming from an external link (not a search engine result, i.e. a mention in a blog article);
- **Social** - Same as the first two scenarios, except coming from an external social media link (not a search engine result, i.e. a mention in a Facebook, Linkedin, or Twitter post);
- **Affiliate** - From an affiliate link to the product page;
- **PPC / paid traffic** - From a paid ad linked to the page;
- **Direct** - email.
- Recruiters; and
- Connectors (referrals).
