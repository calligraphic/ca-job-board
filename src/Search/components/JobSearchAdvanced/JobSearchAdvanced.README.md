After job search results, use modal that  asks if they want to get updates (alerts) for any similar jobs.  If not logged in, ask them to Input email address. If account already exists, check if alert exists, if not, then add alert.  If user does not exist, then add user and add alert.)

**See Note in Job Posting:** Needs to have a priority weighting, so admin or the "Premium" packages can boost a posting in the listing (affects search also).

##### Job Search Save

jobboardmount.com also has an option to save Job Searches, seems similar to alerts:

![jobSearchSave1](../../../../public/images/jobSearchSave1.png)



![jobSearchSave2](../../../../public/images/jobSearchSave2.png)



![jobSearchSave3](../../../../public/images/jobSearchSave3.png)



**Premium Jobs** should be listed at the beginning of filtered lists for full length of job listing.

##### General Notes on Search

Matchwork.com uses a Microsoft search product. From the site:

> "Within the FAST ESP product is, among other great features, a synonym dictionary which we keep updated with relevant job title and location associations so that jobseekers still will find relevant jobs even though they might refer to a job title with the different word than found on jobs. To name an example most jobseekers searching for ‘account manager’ would also like to see results for ’sales executive’. MatchWork's search solution have a vast association of related job titles and locations and combined with the highly intelligent ranking of results, it therefore delivers only relevant results to jobseekers."

Other advantages of FAST ESP listed:

- **Search statistics**, e.g. which search terms generates 0 result searches and most popular search terms
- **Auto-complete** freetext searches
- **Boosting** – upsell jobs boosted to the top of the search results page for relevant searches or negatively boost aggregated volume jobs

Matchwork.com also has search by predefined links, divided into 3 categories:

- Job Categories/sectors
- Locations
- Job Titles

Matchwork.com also has faceted search. Possible facets: search by distance (radial search), job category, job location (several levels), job type, date posted and salary

Should also be able to backfill job listings into search results, as well as into job listings views.
