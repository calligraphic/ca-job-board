Employers shouldn't have full access to all resumes so they can't abuse the system.  Employers (or competitors) shouldn't be able to mass download resumes. Having them buy resumes avoids that, or some preset limit of resumes pulled from the system per active job posting. From the specs:

> The resume search will be tied into the job postings themselves.  This means when they view their list of jobs, they can then click to see all the job seekers who match the criteria of that job, such as location radius, job category, etc.  Employers will then have the ability to send the job seekers a message in the system.

Should also pull Connectors in that region to show to Employer, in addition to resumes.

Faced search has an “Apply Filter” button at the bottom:

##### Backfilling for Resume Search

Indeed.com provides resume search for free, and sells the email address for $1.00 each. The system could be configured to backfill the resume search results with resumes from Indeed, and either fetch contact information from Indeed and mark up their cost, or include a certain number free, or however makes sense. jobsg8.com offers a similar resume service to Indeed, but it is the only market they are in and they have a "pay-per-application" payment structure for resumes. I don't know how they track applications (if it has to be done on their site). Danger in getting resumes from third parties that aren't a good match, the job board is likely to attract more targeted resume search results.
