The Awards module will need to make use of cut-points in other modules, to trigger awards on desired behavior. For this, an eventing system should be used. Modules with cut points to trigger on:

- Register
- Apply for a Job

Conceptually, the Awards module should be a two-step progression:

1. Show award for meeting a goal;
2. Introduce next goal.

Provides a uniform way to display action goals across different pages. Can be used to motivate users to expand their resume by adding a video or filling out their profile in general.

##### Email Integration

Should be able to configure awards to contact user via email for events. For example, to send an email after a job user applies to a job posting:  "Congratulations on applying - Now do you want to make sure you get the interview
".

##### Employer Bounty

This is a feature of the Awards system, but is controlled by the Connector Program. It should allow employers to set a bounty on a job posting, and then for the employer to be able to control which connectors can see the bounty and push a notification to those connectors. Available only for Premium jobs.
