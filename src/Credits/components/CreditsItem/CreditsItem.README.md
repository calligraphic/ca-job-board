Maybe call "Job Packs" instead of "Credits"


Should be able to add Credits that are specific to an employer or group of employers, so that it's possible to give special pricing at the account level. Same with Subscriptions.

See note in Subscriptions about pass-through billing (i.e. providing billing for Indeed services, with a markup).

##### Recruiters and Credits / Subscriptions

Credits are owned by Departments in an Employer profile. Need Recruiter packages and a mechanism for Recruiters to transfer credits to companies that they have appropriate permissions to do so with. Transactions needs to have a view for Recruiter transactions. Maybe the way to do this is create a "shadow" company for the Recruiter profile. Recruiters would then gain the ability to manage various companies / properties by assigning them to Departments (re-nameable, for example "Clients") and get appropriate Transaction reporting. Need an Employer-to-Employer transfer credits / subscriptions tool to allow this to work. Recruiter profile needs to match appropriate functionality of Employer profile, but should present it differently.

##### Featured Options to buy:

- Featured Employer Package
- Featured Job Seeker Package
- Featured Recruiter Package
- Featured Resume Package
- Featured Job Listing Package

Specs mention custom pricing for different types of jobs. This might be best handled by having multiple premium job packets, and requiring certain premium packages for certain job categories. See Subscriptions and Credits.

##### Admin Create / Edit View
