The idea of "Questionnaires" overlaps with interview guides. Those can be (a) company-wide, (b) position or department specific, and (c) hiring manager specific, including allowing all three levels to combine.  Seems like the functionality is similar to a FAQ-builder type of application.

Breezy lets you add Questionnaires to different stages as a notification trigger, and you can take automated actions based on the answers to the questionnaires (move them to next stage, send a follow-up email, send a new questionnaire, disqualify them):

Instead of written questionnaire, could also have candidate provide video assessment (answer question(s) in a short video format);

Had a section "assessments":

## Assessments

- Define New Assessment Template
- List View
  - Sort by status - in-process, completed, graded
  - Sort by Type
- List Detail View
- Item View
- Create View
- Edit View (with delete option)

Employers can pre-select candidatesâ€™ applications by activating assessment questionnaires linked to jobs. Applications obtained will contain pass/no pass score. Instant replies and bulk messaging are available in job board software to support communication.
