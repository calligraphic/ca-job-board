If you operate a business with 15+ staff in the USA or you’re a contractor or subcontractor for the US government, you’ll need to comply with the EEO laws or OFCCP regulations. 

When you post a job, your company careers site should display an Equal Opportunity Employer disclaimer. Applicants will have the option to fill out the voluntary EEO survey directly after applying for a job, or they’ll receive an email with a friendly reminder to come back and complete it later.

Tracking the reason for disqualifying a candidate is required as part of the EEO report. As you move to disqualify a candidate in the Candidate Management workflow, simply select a reason from the list provided or enter a custom response of your own.
