One feature of a premium employer job account can be "targeted job advertising",  PPC advertising via Google adwords or social media controlled by the system. Would need infrastructure to push ad buys, and design tools to create ads. Also integration to Subscriptions / Credits.

##### Note from correspondence:

> Concerning "XML Feeds - Customized feeds to distribute to places like Indeed, ZipRecruiter, etc.", what kinds of customizations should be configurable per distribution channel (i.e. "only older than three days", "only in these states")?
>
> ZipRecruiters specifically allows us to change the bid amount for the job.  So rather than \$0.25 per click, it can be changed to $0.35 per click.  We actually have that set up now in the system as a field in the job listing, which then flows through the XML feed.  (We don't use that override much, but it is handy.)
