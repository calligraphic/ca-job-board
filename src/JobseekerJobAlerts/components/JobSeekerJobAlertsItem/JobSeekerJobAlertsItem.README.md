- Config by JobSeeker - SMS, email

One way to increase sign-up for job alerts is to place a box like this after every ten listings or so:

![jobalert5](../../../../public/images/jobalert5.png)

Possibility to sign up for SMS / E-Mail alerts. Option to Export Job Alerts, either into either a xls or a csv file.

Need to integrate with a cron process to periodically send job alerts.

When Alerts are sent to a job seeker (in system notification, email, SMS), they have the option of responding with an "I'm interested in this Job" link to the job page. There should also be an "I know someone who might be interested in this job" kind of link for Connectors Program.

Connectors may subscribe to job alerts, to pass the lead on to people they know who might be interested. Monarch has connector auto-posting, which allows connectors to create a job alert based upon location, company, etc.  And when they create the job alert, allow them to set up auto-posting, which means that when the job is posted, and their alert is triggered, the system will auto-post the job on their LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc.

##### Analytics

Job Alerts should report in Analytics / Admin Dashboard, and also in Employer Dashboard for their jobs (ad not report if none were sent!). Smartjobboard has the following views for Job Alerts:

![jobAlert4](../../../../public/images/jobAlert4.png)



It also has filtering based in to find a job alert quickly.

Also smartjobboard has option to Export Job Alerts, either into either a xls or a csv file.
