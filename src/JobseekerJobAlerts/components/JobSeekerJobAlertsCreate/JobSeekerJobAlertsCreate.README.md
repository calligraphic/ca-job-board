Should be flexible - choose to receive job alerts every day or every week, and definitely an unsubscribe link in each email. "If there are no new positions, you wonâ€™t get an email."

Alert Criteria:

- Keywords
- Classification / Position Title
- Location
- Salary (hourly / salaried, minimum / maximum)
- Type (Full Time / Part Time, Permanent / Temporary)

Some allow something like "set up to five job alerts", need a way for candidates to view their alerts because they might have them in for different locations, positions, etc. Maybe just one job alert per email address, and allow you to have multiple positions, etc.?

The Item Detail Create (above) has an Alert Search Params area, where you can set what to trigger the alert on: job type, job category, state, and a lot of other seemingly useless criteria.
