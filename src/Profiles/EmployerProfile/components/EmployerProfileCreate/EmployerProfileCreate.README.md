Users can create multiple companies. From the specs:

> "When a user initially sets up the account, the system should assume they just want one single company profile.  However, there should be a way for them to add additional company profiles (for recruiters, generally, who want to post on behalf of their client companies).  At that point, the system will allow them to see the multiple companies and edit each one."

Specs include the following database fields for company profiles:

1. Company ID
2. Company name
3. Name of primary employer manager
4. Number of jobs all time
5. Number of active jobs
6. Published/unpublished
