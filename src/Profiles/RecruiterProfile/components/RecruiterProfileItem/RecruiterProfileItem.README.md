**Users can have multiple profiles.**

Display **custom fields**. Item view needs a **section organization**, so the custom fields know where to display.

##### Recruiters and Credits / Subscriptions

Credits are owned by Departments in an Employer profile. Need Recruiter packages and a mechanism for Recruiters to transfer credits to companies that they have appropriate permissions to do so with. Transactions needs to have a view for Recruiter transactions. Maybe the way to do this is create a "shadow" company for the Recruiter profile. Recruiters would then gain the ability to manage various companies / properties by assigning them to Departments (re-nameable, for example "Clients") and get appropriate Transaction reporting. Need an Employer-to-Employer transfer credits / subscriptions tool to allow this to work. Recruiter profile needs to match appropriate functionality of Employer profile, but should present it differently.

##### Dashboard

A Recruiting Portal, so that **Recruiters** can manage and track their candidates progress.
