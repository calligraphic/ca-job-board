**Candidates** have a many-to-one relationship with **employers**, and access control so that employers can grant a **recruiter** access to some or all of the information. 

A Candidate record can point to a JobSeeker profile, or be loaded by the employer (from a mail-in resume, for example).

 If an employer wants to use a Candidate for multiple job openings, they can either clone it or keep them linked with an explanation of the effect (everything shows up for both).

Display **custom fields**. Item view needs a **section organization**, so the custom fields know where to display.

The Candidate feature provides a container for the following:

- all candidate info - JobSeekerProfile plus add'l like contact numbers
- team notes
- social accounts
- update and review scorecards
- offers
- one-click option to email candidate
- one-click option to schedule meetings
- collaborate with employer's team
- make an Offer.
