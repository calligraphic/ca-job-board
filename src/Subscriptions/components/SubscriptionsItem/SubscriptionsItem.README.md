- Should be able to add Subscriptions that are specific to an employer or group of employers, so that it's possible to give special pricing at the account level. Same with Credits.
- Should offer Subscription targeting employers to mass import their existing job postings. Discount per job; free premium upgrade credits after preset number of jobs uploaded, additional premium upgrade credits are discounted, and other benefits.
- Pass-through billing: allow Employers to manage their job postings on other platforms (like Indeed) through our job board features, including billing. Examples include changing Indeed levels, zip alerts, and cross-posting to different platforms.

##### Recruiters and Credits / Subscriptions

Credits are owned by Departments in an Employer profile. Need Recruiter packages and a mechanism for Recruiters to transfer credits to companies that they have appropriate permissions to do so with. Transactions needs to have a view for Recruiter transactions. Maybe the way to do this is create a "shadow" company for the Recruiter profile. Recruiters would then gain the ability to manage various companies / properties by assigning them to Departments (re-nameable, for example "Clients") and get appropriate Transaction reporting. Need an Employer-to-Employer transfer credits / subscriptions tool to allow this to work. Recruiter profile needs to match appropriate functionality of Employer profile, but should present it differently.

##### Featured Options to buy:

- Featured Employer Package
- Featured Job Seeker Package
- Featured Recruiter Package
- Featured Resume Package
- Featured Job Listing Package

Specs mention custom pricing for different types of jobs. This might be best handled by having multiple premium job packets, and requiring certain premium packages for certain job categories. See Subscriptions and Credits.
