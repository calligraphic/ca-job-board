Pull Request Submission Guidelines

1. Create the development environment

2. Make your changes in a new git branch:

  git checkout -b my-fix-branch master

3. Create your patch commit, including appropriate test cases.

4. Run `npm run lint` to ensure your commit has followed the
   automatically enforced coding rules.

5. Run all tests with `npm run test`.

6. Commit your changes, using a commit message that conforms to the Angular
   Commit Messages Conventions. This allows us to update CHANGELOG
   programmatically.

     <type>(<scope>): <subject>
     <BLANK LINE>
     <body>
     <BLANK LINE>
     <footer>

7. Push your branch to GitHub:

   git push origin my-fix-branch

8. In GitHub, send a pull request to:

     calligraphic/storyboard-publish-versioned:master

9. Your pull request will trigger the Travis and Appveyor CI integration.
   If you find that the Travis integration has failed, look into the logs on
   Travis to find out if your changes caused test failures, the commit message
   was malformed etc. If you find that the tests failed or times out for
   unrelated reasons, you can ping a team member so that the build can be
   restarted.

That's it! Thank you for your contribution! After your pull request is merged,
you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream)
repository.
